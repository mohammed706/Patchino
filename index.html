                <h2 class="titletext"><span>A</span>bout Us</h2>
                <p>More specifically, we make coffee that kicks ass, and we’ve done it for over 20 years.It’s exceptional tasting coffee. And that could be why we’re Canada’s #1 selling Whole Bean coffee.                        
                    But it could also be because all our coffee is Organic. And all our coffee is Fairtrade. And it’s all deep and delicious, roasted right in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. It could also be because our customers are loyal, fervent and demand goodness in every cup.
                
                    And it’s not just our coffee that’s good. We were named the #1 Best Workplace in Canada by Great Place to Work® in 2018. We were named a 2015 Fairtrade favourite product. We know how to work hard and have fun. And we think we’re just getting started.
                        
                    We believe great coffee is the answer to many things.

                    <p> What makes a community?  Where do you find it?  Many people think communities are formed through shared experience.  Whether it’s a community of writers, artists or an ethnic community – they are bound by commonalities.
                         Neighborhood communities are formed through shared spaces – places where people gather, meet friends, and recognize friendly faces.  1369 strives to be the coffeehouse you call home.  We want to be your third place – away from work and home – that you feel comfortable enough to read, hang out in, meet friends, or get some work done</p>

                    <p>A lot has happened here since our founding in 1993.  Partners have met, theses and books have been written, and friends have been made. Here are just a few of the stories from our regulars:

                            As we entered the 1369 we immediately felt a connection to that place. It was nice, warm and the tea and cookies were delicious. Just what we needed to see, a bit of light in all our chaos.”
                            
                            - Tim and Laura
                            What has made 1369 part of the fabric of our lives (and a near daily stop) are the people behind the counter and the interest that they take in their customers.”
